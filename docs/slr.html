        <h2>Research Process and Cycles</h2>
        <p>We adopted the <em>design science</em> methodology, a structured process comprising three primary phases:
            <em>context awareness</em>, <em>solution synthesis</em>, and <em>solution validation</em>.  Our iterative
            process was organized into three cycles, each encompassing the design science phases to understand the
            problem context, devise a solution, and validate it.</p>

        <h4>First Cycle: Initial Investigation</h4>

        <p>The first research cycle aimed to explore the current state of Digital Twin architectures.  A Systematic
            Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify key architectural elements and pinpoint limitations in
            existing approaches.</p>
        <p>We used the search string to perform a systematic literature review to understand the studies discussing
            DT architectures. The SLR followed the activities shown in Figure 2.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-center text-muted">Figure 2: Systematic Literature Review Process.</p>

        </p>

        <p>In short, we performed the search using Scopus and retrieved 5508 studies. We then applied the inclusion
            and exclusion criteria (IC/EC) from Table 1 below to filter the relevant studies, executed forward and
            backward snowballing, obtaining the final set of <em>45 primary studies</em>. The results of Scopus
            query and the selection process based on the IC/EC
            criteria are available in the <em>ScopusQueryResults.xlsx</em> available in the <a

       <p>Finally, we extracted key information from the selected primary studies using a defined classification
           scheme. The detailed analysis can be found in the <em>SelectedPaperAnalysis.xlsx</em> file, which is
           included in the <a href="../replicationpackage/replicationpackage.zip" class="text-decoration-none"
                              download><strong>replicationpackage.zip</strong></a>.
        </p>


        <h4>Second Cycle: Preliminary Design</h4>
        <p>In the second research cycle, the architectural elements (internally validated) were used to create the
            first draft of the Digital Twin Reference Architecture. The initial version of TwinArch was documented
            using the Software Engineering Institute <em>Views & Beyond</em> methodology.
            The draft was presented to five practitioners, including academic experts and
            industry professionals, participating to one of the project supporting this work. Their feedback guided
            further improvements that lead to the refinement of TwinArch.</p>

        <h4>Third Cycle: Final Artifact Development</h4>
        <p>The third research cycle focused on refining TwinArch based on feedback from practitioners, which
            highlighted the importance of incorporating existing Digital Twin platforms into the TwinArch design. To
            address this, a <em>specific search of Digital Twin platforms and frameworks</em> was conducted.</p>

        <p> The search process involved three primary channels: <em>(1)</em> the Google search engine, to gain a broad
            overview of available platforms; <em>(2)</em> Google Scholar, to examine academic literature and analyses
            of Digital Twin technologies; and <em>(3)</em> GitHub repositories and official websites, to identify
            open-source projects with active development and community engagement.
        </p>

        <p>Among the available solutions, the final selected platforms—<strong>Eclipse Ditto</strong>, <strong>Azure
            Digital Twins</strong>, and <strong>FIWARE</strong>— ensure representation across different categories
            of Digital Twin solutions, balancing openness, functionality, and cross-domain applicability. This
            in-depth examination provided a detailed understanding of each platform’s specific characteristics,
            enabling us to refine the architectural elements to better align  with existing Digital Twin solutions
            and include practical examples.</p>

        <p>The final validation involved an online survey of <em>20 Digital Twin experts</em> from academia and
            industry. Details about the survey and the obtained results can be found on the dedicated webpage:
